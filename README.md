# Netflix Autoplay Chrome Extension

An extension for autoplay that includes a feature to shutdown the computer when done.

To use the "Sleep" function you must run the install.bat file (it will be in the popup for the extension.)

You probably need to run that as an Administrator - it needs to copy some files and update the registery.

If you open %LOCALAPPDATA%\Netflix-Autoplay\shutdown.bat it has options for Sleep, Hibernate, Shutdown, and Lock - It is set to Sleep, but you can change it around however you like.

Oh, this only works in Chrome, and I have only tested it on Windows 7.
